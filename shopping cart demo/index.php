 <p>Technological products are material (tangible) objects that have been designed by people
 and developed through technological practice to serve particular functions.
In every technological product there is a crucial relationship between the 
(chemical) composition and structure of the materials used and their performance properties.

For this reason, technologists need to be able to evaluate different materials and select the most suitable for their purpose.

They also need to understand how existing materials can be modified or new materials formulated,
 and how choice of materials impacts on the design, development,
 maintenance, and disposal of technological products.</p>
